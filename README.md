# MarinaWebsite
A website for a lakeside Marina that allows users to register for an account, login and lease slips. This project was created using C#, .NET Framework 4.8 and an Entity Framework DB-First approach for course work at SAIT. Images were taken from unsplash.com, randomuser.me or created by me.
1.	You must add the SQL database to SQL Express. Run InlandMarinaScript_JP.sql in SSMS.
2.	Run the website using IIS Express. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge work best. Internet Explorer does not display correctly.
